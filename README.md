5. **Machine Learning Model Creation and Evaluation:**
   - **Scikit-Learn (sklearn):** This comprehensive machine learning library is used to construct and evaluate classification models. It offers a wide range of tools for model training, testing, and evaluation.
     - **Algorithms:**
       - **Logistic Regression:** A powerful algorithm for binary and multiclass classification tasks.
       - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classifies instances based on the majority class of their neighbors.
       - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Constructs hyperplanes to separate classes in high-dimensional space.
       - **Decision Trees:** Utilizes tree structures for classification based on feature splits.

     - **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
       - **Accuracy:** Measures the overall correctness of the model.
       - **Precision:** Quantifies the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances.
       - **Recall:** Measures the model's ability to capture all positive instances.
       - **F1 Score:** Combines precision and recall into a single metric.

By leveraging these powerful tools and libraries, these machine learning projects aim to achieve accurate and insightful results in the domain of classification.
